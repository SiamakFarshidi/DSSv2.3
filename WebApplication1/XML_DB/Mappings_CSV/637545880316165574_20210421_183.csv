Liquid democracy combines many of the upsides of each while doing away with most of their weaknesses. With liquid democracy[comma] you have the option of delegating your vote to an expert that represents your views. Alternatively[comma] you can decide to vote on any given issue yourself. It enables the participants to freely lend and recover the decision power to people they trust to have most knowledge[comma] experience[comma] and interest making the best decisions.

Rather than voting directly on a bill[comma] you delegate your vote to a sitting member of parliament who casts your vote on your behalf. You can change your delegate as often as you like and be as active in the political process as you wish. Those who wish to be less involved can keep the same delegate indefinitely[comma] and their delegate will continue to cast votes on their behalf. This would ease the burden of voting as there would be no requirement to make everyone vote regularly and at the same time in order to achieve a parliament that represents the wishes of the people. Alternatively[comma] those who wish to become more involved can change their delegate as often as is necessary to ensure that their vote is cast as they desire. In this way the system effectively achieves direct democracy[comma] without the burden usually associated with direct democracy.
